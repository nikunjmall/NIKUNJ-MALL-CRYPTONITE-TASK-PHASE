•	Connected to port 2220 using bandit0 as username and bandit0 as password.

 

LEVEL 01:
•	Used “ls” command. There was only one directory ,i.e., home directory.
•	It showed Readme file. 
•	Opened the readme file using “cat readme”to concatenate the readme file and get the password.
•	In this step got to learn about the general common commands like ‘cd’, ‘ls’ , ‘cat’ , etc.
 

LEVEL 12:
•	Used exit command to logout and logged in again as username bandit1 and used the password received in the previous step.
•	Again, used the ‘ls’ command to get to know about the files.
•	Got the result ‘-‘,so searched about it online and took help from friends and got to know about special character files.
•	Used “cat ./-“ to read that get password.

 

LEVEL 23:

•	Used the command *** cat ‘spaces in this filename’*** to concatenate on that file and got the password.

 

LEVEL 34:
•	Used the exit command to logout.
•	Logged in as username bandit3 and used the previous password.
•	Used the “ls” command again and got to know that there was a file named “inhere”.
•	But I was mistaken as it was not a file but a folder so I used the “cd inhere” command to get into that folder.
•	Again used the ls command but got no files so thought that there might be hidden files.
•	Used “ls -a” command to get the hidden files.
•	Used “cat .hidden” command to get the hidden files and got the password.

•	Again used the ls command and got to know about the inhere folder.
•	Used the “cd inhere” command to get into inhere command.
•	Again used ls command to know the files kept in the inhere folder and found out that there were 10 files.
•	Extracted each file using **cat <-file(x)** where I used all the file numbers one by one inplace of x.
 

LEVEL 56:
•	Used the exit command to logout
•	Logged in using username bandit5 and the previous password
•	Used ls command and then **cd inhere** to get get into the inhere folder
•	Again used ls command and found out many ***maybehere(x)** folders where x is the folder number
•	It was mentioned in the question that the file was human readable and not executable and was 1033c in size.
•	Used the command “find .-type f -size 1033c ! -executable” as it was given in the hint that find command might be used.
•	Got the file ./maybehere07/.file02 
•	Used cat ./maybehere07/.file02

 

LEVEL 67:

•	Used the given conditions in the bandit game question and used the command ’find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c’
•	The ‘/’ here searches everywhere.

level 7-> 8
 find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
Flag - z7WtoNQU2XfjmMtWA8u5rN4vzqu4v99S

level 8 > 9
 1. here the piping operator will be used (|)
 2. first to sort the data using sort command 
 3. and then find the line that occurs only once using the command uniq -u
 4. the password appears.

 level 9 >10

 1. we know that password is in human readable form
 2. use the strings command to extract the human readable form
 3. it is given that it is preceded by several "=" characters.
 4. use the grep -E command to get the password

level 10 >11

1.used ls to get data.text file
2. used cat to get the base64 data
 used the command base64 -d to decode the base64 data and got the password 

 level 11 >12
 1. used ls and got data.txt
 2. used cat command as always to read 
 3. got an unusal line . it was told that the password is 13 letters further in the alphabet
 4. here we know about the command tr
 5. used the command tr abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM
 6. got the password

level 12 > 13

1. It is known that our password lies in the ‘data.txt’ file. So we display all its contents using the cat command.
2. Given that this is a hexdump we must decode it. However before doing that we copy data.txt into another directory as instructed in the question
3. Since we are now working on the data.txt file in the /tmp/tan directory we change our cwd to it.
4. We now undo the hexdump and store the obtained file in a new file, namely ‘data 
5. As we see, it is a gzip file, which means we have to use gzip command for decompression.
So just like in the previous steps, we decompress it
6. Since this is not compressed, we just need to extract it.
‘data5.bin’ is our extracted file, the file type of which is:
7. Performing the same steps as we did previously in order to extract files from data5.bin:
To get the file type of data6.bin:
8. It is a bzip2 compressed file, so we follow the same procedure as before: ‘data’ is the decompressed file.
To get the file type of data
9. by doing the same procedure again we get the password

level 13 > 14

1. the password was not stored in bandit13
2. used ls and got the ssh.privatekey
3. here we come to know about a new ssh function that can be used to login in bandit14 using the private key that was present
 4. used the command ssh bandit14@localhost -i ssh.privatekey and got the access to bandit14
 5. searches for the file name given in the question and got a list of passwords
6. used cat to obtain the password

level 14>15

1. in the question it is given that we have to use the port 30000 and change the ip address to obtain the key
2. here we come to know about the function telnet 
3. used the function telnet and change the port to 30000 
4. it asked to submit the key in the previous question and got a new key to log in to bandit 15
